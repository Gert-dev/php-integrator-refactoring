This package provides refactoring capabilities for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Method extraction.
  * Constructor generation.
  * Getter and setter generation.
  * Unimplemented abstract method generation.
  * Unimplemented interface method generation.
  * Docblock generation (press `alt-enter` whilst on a functionlike, classlike or constant).
