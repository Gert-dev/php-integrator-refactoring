# php-integrator/atom-refactoring
## Legacy
This is a legacy version that required PHP >= 7.1. Since 3.6, its functionality is included in the [base package](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base) and installing it separately is no longer necessary.

## About
This package provides refactoring capabilities for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

**Note that the [intentions](https://github.com/steelbrain/intentions) package is also required. Intentions trigger using the `alt-enter` key by default.**

What is included?
  * Method extraction.
  * Method overriding.
  * Constructor generation.
  * Getter and setter generation.
  * Unimplemented abstract method generation.
  * Unimplemented interface method generation.
  * Docblock generation (press `alt-enter` whilst on a functionlike, classlike or constant).
